# Tyson Jeffreys

Systems-oriented developer focused on applied architecture, open research, and experimental tooling.

## Current Focus

- Designing and iterating on **Concept Lab**, an experimental research environment for structured systems thinking
- Publishing long-form white papers exploring systems design, baseline regulation, and AI infrastructure
- Building open technical tools that support research and applied development workflows

## Research & Writing

My work combines hands-on technical development with long-form conceptual exploration.  
White papers are published openly (OSF and mirrored here where appropriate).

I’m particularly interested in:

- Systems architecture
- Baseline regulation and structural design
- AI infrastructure and applied implementation
- Tooling for structured research environments

## Collaboration

I care deeply about alignment between ideas, implementation, and the teams that carry them forward.

I’m open to collaboration with organizations and teams where there is strong technical and cultural alignment.

## Support

If you find value in the research or tools, you can support continued open work through GitHub Sponsors.
